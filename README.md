# React Project

## Overview
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed and maintained by Facebook. It allows developers to build large, complex web applications by breaking the UI into reusable components. React manages the applicationâ€™s state efficiently using a virtual DOM, which minimizes direct manipulation of the actual DOM and enhances performance.

This project demonstrates a simple application built with React. It features a structured component-based architecture, allowing easy scalability and maintainability.

## Features
- **Component-Based Architecture**: React encourages breaking down the user interface into small, reusable components.
- **Virtual DOM**: Efficiently updates and renders components, improving performance.
- **State and Props**: Manages the dynamic data flow within and between components.
- **Hooks**: Simplifies the way you handle state and side effects (like fetching data or managing subscriptions).
- **React Router**: Enables navigation and routing in single-page applications (SPAs).
